This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue in Swift involving the `reduce` function and optional values.  The `bug.swift` file shows code that compiles without errors but results in a runtime crash when attempting to reduce an array of optional integers. The `bugSolution.swift` provides a corrected version illustrating how to safely handle optional values within the reduce operation to prevent runtime crashes. This is a critical example illustrating the importance of careful consideration when working with optionals and higher-order functions in Swift.
