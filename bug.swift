let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)

print(sum) // Output: 15

let strings = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

let combined = strings.reduce("", +)

print(combined) // Output: applebananacherry

This looks straightforward, but a subtle issue arises when dealing with optional values within the array.  Consider this scenario:

let optionalNumbers: [Int?] = [1, 2, nil, 4, 5]

let optionalSum = optionalNumbers.reduce(0, +) //This compiles, but results in a runtime error
print(optionalSum) //This will cause a runtime crash because reduce tries to add nil to the sum. 

This code will crash at runtime because the `+` operator cannot handle `nil` values directly.  Swift's type system doesn't catch this at compile time because `reduce` can work with optionals if you provide a way to handle them.
